# Angular2 Starter
A ready-to-go starter project for Angular2 apps using ES6/7+ through Babel and module loading using JSPM. Completely TypeScript-less, yet very syntactically similar which means official Angular examples can be translated with little to no changes.

`git clone https://github.com/piercers/angular2-starter.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Includes Angular examples of:
- Child components
- The Async and JSON pipes
- Data flow between components
- Events
- RxJS integration
